# Given an integer array, nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

# Example:
# Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
# sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
# sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
# sumRange(0, 5) -> -3

# Note:
# You may assume that the array does not change.
# There are many calls to sumRange function.

        self.nums = nums
        # initiate a variable for storing the current sum
