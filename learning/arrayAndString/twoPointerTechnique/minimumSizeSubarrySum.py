# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

# Example: 
# Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

# Follow up:
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).
